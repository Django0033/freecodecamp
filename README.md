# Freecodecamp

Yeah, I know. It might be pointless to have a transcript of the Freecodecamp courses on a repository cause you can go to [www.freecodecamp.org](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and check them out by yourself.

I created this repository by 3 reasons:

> 1. I'm learning to code so I wanted to have my "notes" at hand.
> 2. I just learn about `.md` files and now I take my "notes" in them (they are no "notes" cause I'm practicing Dvorak and I wanted some kind of challenge so I decided to transcript all the courses I'm following).
> 3. I'm learning how to use GitHub so I think that this is a pretty good way to practice.

If you are a new coder like  me and you find this use full, use it to your own benefit (just let me know by saying hi in some way), and if you are a master-duster-buster-two-coder or just wanna help the new ones to learn, please add some material and advices; I will totally appreciate it.

May the force be with you...<br>
Live long and prosper...<br>
And hasta la vista, baby.
