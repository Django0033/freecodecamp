# Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank

In the last challenge, you learned that including an `alt` attribute when using `img` tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases, `alt` text may seem redundant or unnecessary.

When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the `img` still needs an `alt` attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

```HTML
<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
```

Background images usually fall under the `decorative` label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.

_Note_: For images with a caption, you may still want to include `alt` text since it helps search engines catalog the image's content.

## Example

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Deep Thoughts with Master Camper Cat</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Defeating your Foe: the Red Dot is Ours!</h2>
            <p>To Comme...</p>
        </article>
        <img src="samuraiSwords.jpeg" alt="" />
        <article>
            <h2>Is Chuck Norris a Cat Person?</h2>
            <p>To Come...</p>
        </article>
    </body>
</html>
```
