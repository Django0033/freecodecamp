# Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

This challenge will touch on the usege of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the `:hover` pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the `color` of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

```css
a:hover {
    color: red;
}
```

## Example

```html
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }
  a:hover {
    color: blue;
  }


</style>
