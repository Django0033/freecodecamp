# Understand Absolute versus Relative Units

The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with pixels (`px`). Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to `px`, CSS has several different length unit options that you can use.

The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, `in` and `mm` refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but some differences are depending on a screen's resolution.

Relative units, such as `em` or `rem`, are relative to another length value. For example, `em` is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the `font-size` property itself, it's relative to the parent's `font-size`.

Note: Several relative unit options are tied to the size of the viewport. They are covered in the Responsive Web Design Principles section.

## Example

```html
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: red;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
    padding: 1.5em;
  }

  .green-box {
    background-color: green;
    margin: 20px 40px 20px 40px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box green-box">padding</h5>
</div>
```
