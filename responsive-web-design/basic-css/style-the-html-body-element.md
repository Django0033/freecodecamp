# Style the HTML Body Element

Now let's start fresh and talk about CSS inheritance.

Every HTML page has a `body` element.

We can prove that the `body` element exists here by giving it a `background-color` of black.

We can do this by adding the following to our `style` element:

```css
body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

## Example

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: black;
  }
</style>
```
