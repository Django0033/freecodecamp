# Delete HTML Elements

Our phone doesn't have much vertical space.

Let's remove the unnecessary elements so we can start building our CatPhotoApp.

## Example

```html
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
```
