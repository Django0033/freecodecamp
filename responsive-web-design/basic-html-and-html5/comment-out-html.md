# Comment out HTMLPassed

Remember that in order to start a comment, you need to use `<!--` and to end a comment, you need to use `-->`

Here you'll need to end the comment before your `h2` element begins.

## Example

```html
<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
-->
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<!--
<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
-->
```
