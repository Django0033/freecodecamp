# Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document

You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the `html` tags with the `head` and `body` elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the `head` tag. Then any markup with the content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the `body` tag.

Metadata elements, such as `link`, `meta`, `title`, and `style`, typically go inside the head element.

Here's an example of a page's layout:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>The best page ever</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>The best page ever</h1>
    <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in the litter box until treats are fed. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. I like big cats and I can not lie kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. I Meow I could pee on this if I had the energy to slap the owner's face at 5 am until a human fills food dish yet scamper. Knock dish off table head butt cant eats out of my dish scratch the furniture. Make meme, make cute face. Sleep in the bathroom sink chase laser but pee in the shoe. Paw at your fat belly licks your face and eats grass, throw it back up kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
